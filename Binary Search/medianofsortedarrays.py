			#     in this case, we see that l1[0] < l2[N/2] must be true, and thus l1[0] < l2[N/2 + 1]
			#     and thus, l2[N/2] is the meidan
			# Case 2: l1[0] = M:
			#     observe that if l1[0] is the median, then we have l2[N/2] <= l1[0] <= l2[N/2 + 1]
			#     and thus l1[0] is the median

			# An interesting observation is that the median overall list in these three cases is always
			# equal to the median of the list of values [l1[0], l2[N/2], l2[N/2 + 1]], so
			# we can simply take the median of the list [l1[0], l2[N/2], l2[N/2 + 1]]

			# consider. For the sake of simplicity, we will omit these cases. But we notice that
			# the median of the two lists is just the median of the list below
			# [l1[0], l2[N/2-1], l2[N/2], l2[N/2 +  1]]

			# Again, for simplicity, and cleaner coder, we will just use the slower method
