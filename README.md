# algorithms
This is a repository of some of the more interesting algorithms that I've gathered

I'm going to be porting over all of the python code into C++ code for performance
(And also because I'm learning C++)

Basic Algos
  - sorting
    - quicksort
    - bubblesort
    - insertion sort
    - mergesort
    - heapsort
    - timsort
    - radix sort
  - geometry
    - coordinate compression
    - vector math
      - point to line distance
      - line to line distance
      - finding circle from 3 points
      - polygon area
    - area of union of rectangles
  - other
    - maximum subarray sum
    - longest increasing subsequence
    - sliding window minimum/maximum
Tree data structures
  - segment tree
    - n-d segment tree
  - fenwick tree
    - n-d fenwick tree
  - red-black tree
  - avl tree
  - wavelet trees
  - trie
  - treaps
  
Parsing Algorithms
  - cyk
  - earley parser
  - GLR parser
  
Graph Theory
  - pathing graph algos
    - shortest path
    - bellman-ford (SPFA)
    - djikstras
    - all pairs shortest path (Floyd-warshall)
  - trees
    - minimum/maximum spanning tree
      - prims
      - krustals
      - An interesting problem is the cartesian product of 2 trees and trying to take the sum of the weights of the min/max spanning tree of the product

Distributed Algorithms
  - Merge sort
  - Leader election
  - Distributed search/binary search
  - Spanning trees
  -
