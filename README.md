# algorithms
This is a repository of some of the more interesting algorithms that I've gathered

I'm going to be porting over all of the python code into C++ code for performance
(And also because I'm learning C++)

Basic Algos

    - [x] quicksort
    - [x] bubblesort
    - [ ] insertion sort
    - [x] mergesort
    - [ ] heapsort
    - [ ] timsort
    - [ ] radix sort
  
  - [ ] other
    - [x] maximum subarray sum
    - [x] longest increasing subsequence
    - [x] sliding window minimum/maximum
Tree data structures
  - [x] segment tree
    - [ ] n-d segment tree
    - [x] persistent segment tree
